The old guy used to say that
a beached whale is at the mercy of ants.
A prince who forgets his place
and tells ministers what to do
is at the mercy of bureaucrats.

A prince maintains his authority by doing nothing.
He knows his place
and builds trust by listening closely.
Ministers conceal their power
but don’t manipulate him.
Instead,
they control the boss by doing their job.

When a prince
doesn’t trust experts
and likes doing it himself,
his power erodes every day
and he has only himself to blame.
Talking down to subordinates
makes it impossible to communicate,
and interference from authority
makes it impossible to maintain control.
If he’s not powerful enough to make them obey,
not ruthless enough to make them pay,
there’s no way for him to influence subordinates.

With joy and anger in their hearts,
with envy and ambition on their sleeves,
those who once knew their place
stop doing the right thing
and start pandering to superiors.
When bureaucrats ignore the law
and follow the wind,
when they’re not rewarded for merit,
not punished for crime,
that’s when high and low are at each other’s throats.

When prince and ministers hate each other,
when the administration is in chaos
and it’s impossible to keep ego in check,
when accusations are made
and it’s impossible to see reason,
when the accused are wronged
and refuse to take responsibility,
that’s when masters have to work even harder,
servants get even more complacent.

So those who would carve with the great craftsman’s blade
rarely don’t cut their hands.
