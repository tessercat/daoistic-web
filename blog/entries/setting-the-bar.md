The old guy used to say that
in a healthy society,
promises are easy to keep,
jobs are easy to do,
traditions are easy to follow,
debts are easy to repay.

So being a student isn’t the same as being a politician,
politicians aren’t teachers.
Teachers, farmers, carpenters, traders,
all have different callings, separate concerns.
Since farmers talk to farmers about granaries,
and teachers talk to teachers about behaviour,
and carpenters talk to carpenters about technique,
and traders talk to traders about prices,
teachers don’t lose control,
carpenters don’t botch jobs,
farmers don’t waste effort,
traders don’t lose money.

We’re happy with our lot in life,
though we’re all different shapes, all different sizes.
We do easy jobs and don’t get in each other’s way,
make mistakes and get corrected,
get it right and get credit.

Visionaries,
forward-thinking people,
they’re geniuses,
but a healthy society
doesn’t ask much of people.
Knowledgeable, ambitious,
argumentative, eloquent,
people know they’re talented,
but even an enlightened master
doesn’t require much of apprentices.

Since a decadent society is abusive,
out of touch with changing norms,
teachers are taskmasters,
but a healthy society
isn’t trying to reform people.

Since we don’t hold students
to impossibly high standards,
we shouldn’t expect political culture
to live up to our unrealistic expectations.

Since we shouldn’t rely exclusively on genius
and the standards of a liberal arts education
should be transmitted to society,
and since government institutions
should be protected from fools
and armed forces
should be subject to law,
we don’t need mythic heroes of the past,
but normal people,
because they know what’s real
and what to do about it.

Society today
has high expectations
and blames us when we don’t measure up,
gives us hard jobs
and punishes us when we don’t succeed,
sends us on dangerous missions
and executes us when we aren’t brave.

People are trapped in these three realities.
We respond by polishing our stories
and lying to authorities,
by playing dirty tricks
and taking stupid risks.
Rules are strict,
penalties harsh,
but we can’t help ourselves.
A cornered animal responds by lashing out,
a cornered hen will peck,
desperate people lie.

That's what he meant.
