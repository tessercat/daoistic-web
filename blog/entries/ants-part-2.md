Chase horses on foot,
tear a tendon,
it’s impossible to catch up.
Mount a chariot,
take the reigns,
the team is content under the yoke.
Bólè trained them,
Wángliǎng harnessed them,
an enlightened ruler called for them.
He did none of the work of training or harnessing them,
but he drove them a thousand miles,
admired by every expert charioteer.

The way of the prince
is to do nothing
but to accomplish something,
to stand for something
but not to favour anything.
As soon as he does something, he’s criticized,
and as soon as he favours something, he’s flattered.
As quickly as he’s criticized, he can be coerced,
and as quickly as he’s flattered, he can be convinced.

In the end,
when the power to appoint is at the mercy of others,
it’s impossible to maintain institutions.
Since good foundations don’t crumble,
promises to preserve them mean nothing.
Only spiritual renewal,
and nothing less,
is capable of sustaining them.

When ambition doesn’t tear it apart from the inside,
they say it’s stable.
When corruption doesn’t worm its way in from the outside,
they say it’s safe.
Stable on the inside,
safe from the outside,
when does it act irresponsibly?
Safe from the outside,
stable on the inside,
when doesn’t it get results?

Since he doesn’t manipulate them,
doesn’t force them,
but something motivates them,
and something makes them,
he doesn’t doubt their promises,
doesn’t do the work for them.
He obeys norms,
expects results,
orders them to run the bureaucracy themselves.
He realizes that his own way is not to know how,
that his mandate is to veto abuse.

When it’s like that,
his administration is always well in hand.
