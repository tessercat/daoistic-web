The old guy used to say that
in a healthy society,
promises are easy to keep,
jobs are easy to do,
traditions are easy to follow,
debts are easy to repay.

So being a student isn’t like being a politician,
politicians aren’t teachers.
Teachers, farmers, carpenters, traders,
we all have different callings, separate concerns.
Since farmers talk to farmers about granaries,
and teachers talk to teachers about discipline,
and carpenters talk to carpenters about building,
and traders talk to traders about prices,
teachers don’t lose control,
carpenters don’t botch jobs,
farmers don’t waste the harvest,
traders don’t lose money,
and we're all happy with our lot in life.
Though we look different
and keep to ourselves,
we all do easy jobs and don’t get in each other’s way,
make mistakes and get corrected,
get it right and get credit.

Visionary,
forward-thinking people,
they’re geniuses,
but a healthy society
doesn’t rely on them for much.
Knowledgeable, ambitious,
argumentative, eloquent,
people know they’re talented,
but even an enlightened master
doesn’t ask much of apprentices.
Since a decadent society is conservative,
out of touch with changing times,
its teachers are taskmasters,
but a healthy society
isn’t trying to fix people.
Since we don’t hold students
to impossibly high standards,
we shouldn’t expect much
of politics.
Since we shouldn’t rely exclusively on genius
and society should adopt
basic standards of literacy,
and since government institutions
should be protected from fools
and armed forces
should be subject to law,
we don’t need mythic heroes of the past,
but normal people,
because they know what’s real
and what to do about it.

Society today
has high expectations
and blames us when we don’t measure up,
gives us hard jobs
and punishes us when we don’t succeed,
sends us on dangerous missions
and executes us when we aren’t brave.
People come up against these three realities
and respond by polishing their stories
and lying to authorities,
by playing dirty tricks
and taking stupid risks.
Laws are harsh,
punishment severe,
but we can’t help ourselves.
A cornered animal responds by lashing out,
a cornered hen will peck,
desperate people lie.

That's what he meant.
