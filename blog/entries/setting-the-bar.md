The old guy used to say that
in a healthy society,
promises are easy to keep,
jobs are easy to do,
tradition is easy to follow,
debt is easy to repay.

He meant that
being a student isn’t like being a politician,
politicians aren’t teachers.
Teachers, farmers, builders, merchants,
we all have different callings,
separate concerns.

Since farmers talk to each other about crops,
and teachers talk to each other about discipline,
and builders talk to each other about their craft,
and merchants talk to each other about prices,
teachers don’t lose control,
builders don’t botch jobs,
farmers don’t waste resources,
and merchants don’t lose money.
We're happy with our lot in life
though we're organized differently
and have different specialties.
We do easy jobs
and don’t get in each other’s way,
make mistakes and get corrected,
get it right and get credit.

Visionary,
forward-thinking people,
they’re geniuses,
but a healthy society
doesn’t rely on them for much.
Knowledgeable, ambitious,
argumentative, eloquent,
people know they’re talented,
but even an enlightened master
doesn’t ask much of apprentices.

Since a decadent society is abusive,
out of touch with changing times,
teachers are tyrants,
but a healthy society
doesn't have to control people.

Since we don’t hold students
to impossibly high standards,
we shouldn’t expect institutions
to live up to utopian ideologies.

Since we shouldn’t rely exclusively on genius
and basic literacy
should be the norm,
and since government institutions
should be protected from stupidity
and armed forces
should be subject to law,
we don’t need mythic heroes of the past,
but normal people,
because they know what’s real
and what to do about it.

Society today
has high expectations
and blames us when we don’t measure up,
gives us hard jobs
and punishes us when we don’t succeed,
sends us on dangerous missions
and executes us when we aren’t brave.

People confronted by these three realities
respond by polishing their stories
and lying to authorities,
by playing dirty tricks
and taking stupid risks.
Laws are harsh,
punishment severe,
but we can’t help ourselves.
A cornered animal responds by lashing out,
a cornered hen will peck,
desperate people lie.

That's what he was talking about.
